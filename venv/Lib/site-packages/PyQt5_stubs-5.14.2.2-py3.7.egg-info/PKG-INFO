        # Mypy stubs for the PyQt5 framework
        
        This repository holds the stubs of the PyQt5 framework. It uses the stub files that are
        produced during compilation process of PyQt5. These stub files have been modified by the author
        to allow using them for type-checking via Mypy. This repository is far from complete and the author will
        appreciate any PRs or Issues that help making this stub-repository more reliable.
        
        # Installation
        
        Simply install PyQt5-stubs with pip:
        
            $ pip install PyQt5-stubs
        
        Or clone the latest version from Github and install it via Python setuptools:
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/stlehmann/PyQt5-stubs.git
            $ python setup.py install
        
        
        # Supported Modules
        
        The following modules are supported by PyQt5-stubs:
        
        * QtCore
        * QtWidgets
        * QtGui
        * QtDBus
        * QtNetwork
        * QtOpenGL
        * QtPrintSupport
        * QtSql
        * QtTest
        * QtXml
        * sip
        
        # Building upstream stubs
        The Dockerfile is used to build all of the stubs for the upstream PyQt5 modules.
        The Dockerfile consists of multiple build layers:
        * core: `PyQt5`
        * `PyQt3D`
        * `PyQtChart`
        * `PyQtDataVisualization`
        * `PyQtPurchasing`
        * `PyQtWebEngine`
        * an output layer
        
        Each module build layer deposits its stub files within `/output/` in its
        filesystem. The output layer then collects the contents of each into its own 
        `/output/` dir for export to the host computer. Build args are provided to 
        change the version of each module.
        
        A convenience script, `build_upstream.py`, is provided. It builds the stubs and 
        copies them to the host computer. Make sure you install `docker-py` to use it.
        It builds `$PWD/Dockerfile` (overridden with `--dockerfile`) and outputs the
        stubs to `$PWD/PyQt5-stubs` (overridden with `--output-dir`). 
        
        \* There are a few missing modules: `QtAxContainer`, `QtAndroidExtras`, 
        `QtMacExtras`, and `QtWindowsExtras`. The current project understanding is that
        they need to be built on the target platform, something a Linux-based docker
        image cannot do. The deprecated `Enginio` module is also missing.
